# snake-water-gun-game
im glad to post my new project snake , water , gun game on python. Here's a description of the Snake Water Gun game implemented in Python using if-else statements:

The Snake Water Gun game in Python is a simple text-based game where two players make their choices simultaneously, and the program determines the winner based on predefined rules.

Here's how the game typically works:

1. **Setup**: Two players make their choices between Snake, Water, and Gun.
2. **Rules**:
   - Snake beats Water (because it can drink water).
   - Water beats Gun (because it can rust or damage the gun).
   - Gun beats Snake (because it can shoot the snake).



In this Python function `snake_water_gun`, the choices of both players are compared using  if-else statements. Depending on the combination of choices, it determines and returns the result string indicating which player wins or if it's a tie. The game is interactive, as players can input their choices directly, making it a fun and educational exercise in basic programming logic using conditionals.
